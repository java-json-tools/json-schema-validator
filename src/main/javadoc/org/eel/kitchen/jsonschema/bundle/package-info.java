 * Schema keywords and keyword bundles

 * <p>Classes in this package allow you to build your own keywords and add them
 * to an existing keyword bundle. You can then supply this bundle to your
 * schema factory.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is useful, for instance, if you have an idea for a new keyword
 * and want to experiment with it. See the relevant classes for sample code.</p>
