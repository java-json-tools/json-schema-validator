Internet-Draft                JSON Pointer                  October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) [RFC4627] document.  It is intended to be easily expressed in
   JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.


3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a [Unicode] string containing a sequence of zero or
   more reference tokens, each prefixed by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Since the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have a special meaning
   in JSON Pointer, they need to be encoded as '~0' and '~1'
   respectively, when appearing in a reference token.

   Its ABNF syntax is:

   json-pointer = *( "/" reference-token )
   reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
   unescaped = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
   escaped = "~" ( "0" / "1" )

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).


4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   sequentially evaluated.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence; this is performed by first transforming any

   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as token and their code
      points are position-wise equal.  If a referenced member name is
      not unique in an object, the member that is referenced is
      undefined, and evaluation fails (see below).

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters that represent an unsigned base-10 integer value
         (possibly with leading zeros), making the new referenced value
         is the array element with the zero-based index identified by
         the token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (non-existant) member after the last array element.

   If a reference token is being evaluated against a JSON document,
   implementations will evaluate each token against the document's
   contents, and terminate evaluation with an error condition if it
   fails to resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's
   reference tokens.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error; applications of JSON Pointer thus need to
   specify how it is to be handled, if it is to be useful.


5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C) and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.

   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   Then the following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:


    ""         // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"    "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8


6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets, using UTF-8 [RFC3629], percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to nominate JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC4288]); i.e., just because a document is JSON does not imply that
   JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.

   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #                  // the whole document
    #/foo            ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0         "bar"
    #/               0
    #/a~1b           1
    #/c%25d          2
    #/e%5Ef          3
    #/g%7Ch          4
    #/i%5Cj          5
    #/k%22l          6
    #/%20            7
    #/m~0n           8


7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   This includes, but is not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a non-existent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled; an
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error; others may attempt to recover from missing values by inserting
   default ones.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no impact upon IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Implementations should be aware of this and take appropriate
   precautions.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character, which may not be representable in all programming
   languages.
